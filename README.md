## Getting Started ðŸš€

Making native aimated splash seems like a huge issue but with this package everything is done for. All you need is Json file of your animated object and we can help you to bring them to life. ðŸŽ‡

## Usage ðŸŽ¨

First, add `animated_native_splash` as a dev dependency in your pubspec.yaml file. It belongs in `dev_dependencies` because it is a command line tool.

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  animated_native_splash: ^1.0.0
```

```yaml
animated_native_splash:

  # This package generates native code to customize Flutter's splash

  # jsonFile is the only required parameter.This the file use to setup the animation object.
  jsonFile: assets/splash.json

```

### Run the package

After adding your settings, run the following command in the terminal:

```yaml
flutter pub run animated_native_splash:create
```

Now wait for everything to finish injecting. BOOM you have your animated native splash setup ðŸŽ‰
